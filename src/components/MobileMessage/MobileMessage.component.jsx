          This game can only be played on devices like most tablets and
          computers, I couldn't find a way to make it work properly on mobile
          devices. But hey, all of my other projects work on mobile, go look at
          them in <a href="https://imadfxq.com/">my portfolio</a>
        </p>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
