# React Card Game

Memorization game with a very good user experience, I was watching a tutorial where they were building it, but I went 4 steps ahead and made it 10 times better.

## Features

- Built using React-DOM + JavaScript + SCSS
- Smooth transitions.
- Message for mobile devices.
- Depending on how many turns you made in a match, at the end I will give you a score, it can be perfect, very good, good, and improvable.
- When starting a new game, card position will be shown, and there will be a timeLeftToSeeCards counter
- The logic is extremely well built, so you cannot select two times the same card, or select cards while they are being shown.
- Counters for turns and total cards matched.
- Cards stay flipped if they match.
